      <description>It’s been just over a year since I first posted about the Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline I used to use, I say used to use, because that pipeline is now a little outdated. This posts covers the updated Pipeline I am starting to deploy along side my Terraform code.
Pipeline Overview The pipeline itself has expanded a little and it now not only uses stages but also depending what Terraform is planning on doing it will trigger a manual approval process should there be any resources being destroyed.</description>

      <description>As I move into using Azure DevOps more and more, there is one thing which I really haven’t got on with and that is release pipelines. I didn’t like that I couldn’t easily define it as YAML like I could with build pipelines, even though I don’t like them, there are a few things I do like — like approval gates.
Environments Luckily, there are ways to get around this — the most simple way is to add an Environment and then add an Approval.</description>

      <description>When Apple releases a new version of macOS it always takes a few months for everything to catchup, following my last blog post where I mentioned that I was having problems installing Python on macOS Big Surwhich meant that my preferred method of installing and managing Python using pyenv, which is documented in this blog post, didn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box — and the workarounds suggested workarounds on GitHub made my shell really slow.</description>

      <title>Migrating my Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry</title>

      <description>A few weeks after the final draft of the fourth edition of Mastering Docker was submitted Docker made the announcement that they would be making changes to the retention of images in Docker Hub as well as the introduction of rate limits.
These changes make complete sense given that at the time of writing this post there are over 150 million images taking up over 15 PB of storage, of that 10 PB of the images haven’t been accessed in over 6 months and 4.</description>

      <description>I got my invite for GitHub Codespaces the other day and I thought I would have a quick play with it as having an an online IDE sounds like it could come in handy.
If you know me — you will know that I am not a developer, but I do a lot of work in Visual Studio Code as that is where I tend to develop work on a lot of the infrastructure as code projects using Terraform and Ansible, as well as Docker projects.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline</title>

      <description>In my last post I wrote about how I created an Azure DevOps pipeline using Ansible in a more “Terraform” way, however, although I have used Terraform and Azure DevOps quite a bit I realised I didn’t really have a template for a pipeline.
Before we look at the pipeline itself I should point out that is uses the the Terraform Azure Pipeline extension by Microsoft DevLabs from the Visual Studio Marketplace, if you are following along with this post please ensure that the extension is installed in your organisation before proceeding.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Ansible Pipeline</title>

      <description>I thought it was was about time that I started to have a play with Azure DevOps a little more than I have been doing, one of the things I have always meant to look at in the past is using DevOps to run Ansible playbooks.
However the Ansible Task recommended by Microsoft has always put me off, the reason for this is that this task requires a Virtual Machine to run Ansible — this to me always seemed a little overkill.</description>

      <title>Ansible and the Azure Rest API</title>

      <description>Over the last few months I have been doing more and more work with Ansible to manage end to end deployments in Azure. For the most part Ansible’s core set of Azure modules work with no problems and more than do the job.
However, with the rate which Microsoft are both adding new features and functionality it is difficult to keep up. The core Ansible modules rely on several Azure python libraries to be updated before the functionality can be added or introduced to the core module set.</description>
