      <description>It’s been just over a year since I first posted about the Azure DevOps Terraform Pipeline I used to use, I say used to use, because that pipeline is now a little outdated. This posts covers the updated Pipeline I am starting to deploy along side my Terraform code.
Pipeline Overview The pipeline itself has expanded a little and it now not only uses stages but also depending what Terraform is planning on doing it will trigger a manual approval process should there be any resources being destroyed.</description>

      <description>As I move into using Azure DevOps more and more, there is one thing which I really haven’t got on with and that is release pipelines. I didn’t like that I couldn’t easily define it as YAML like I could with build pipelines, even though I don’t like them, there are a few things I do like — like approval gates.
Environments Luckily, there are ways to get around this — the most simple way is to add an Environment and then add an Approval.</description>
